## Features

- **TROJAN**, **Shadowsocks/v2ray** and **VLESS** protocols (Powered by XRay project)
- **Camouflage domains** with a real website to reduce the risk of being blocked by probing
- **One-command** installation and management
- Support **multiple** domains and IPs, and **auto-select** the best route on user's devices
- **Multi-user management** with connection limitation

## Requirements

- A server running Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- At least 1 GB of RAM
- One domain/subdomain pointed to a CDN (such as Cloudflare), and the CDN set to `Full` SSL mode

## Recommended configuration

- Two domains behind a CDN (such as Cloudflare), one for the panel/update and one for the VPN itself
- One or more extra servers for the secondary proxy (512MB RAM is enough for secondary proxies)

## Installation

1. Buy a domain and point its DNS to a CDN (such as Cloudflare), and set the CDN to `Full` SSL mode. [help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quiniapiezoelectricity/Libertea/master/docs/cloudflare-full-ssl.png)

2. Set your server's IP address to the CDN's DNS record, and make sure CDN is enabled. (Orange cloud icon in Cloudflare)

3. run the following command on your server and follow the instructions.

       curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quiniapiezoelectricity/Libertea/master/bootstrap.sh -o /tmp/bootstrap.sh && bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh install

    *The installation may take a few minutes.*

## Update

To update, just run the following command on your server:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quiniapiezoelectricity/Libertea/master/bootstrap.sh -o /tmp/bootstrap.sh && bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh update

## Uninstall

If you want to uninstall Liberta or Liberta-secondary-proxy from your server for any reason, run the following command on your server:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quiniapiezoelectricity/Libertea/master/bootstrap.sh -o /tmp/bootstrap.sh && bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh uninstall

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Does Libertea keep my domains and IPs safe from being blocked?

Libertea uses SSL-based protocols, so the traffic is not distinguishable from normal HTTPS traffic. Also by setting a Camouflage domain to your Libertea installation, the risk of active probing gets reduced. However, GFW may still block your domains and IPs based on usage after a period of time. It is recommended to use *multiple* domains and secondary proxies, and periodically change your secondary proxy IPs.

##### Can I route regional traffic directly (without going through VPN)?

Yes. In the admin panel, go to the *Settings* tab, and in the *Route regional IPs directly* section, select the countries you want to go through directly.

##### Some of my servers or CDN plans have limited traffic. Can I prioritize servers?

Yes. You can set a priority for each domain and secondary proxy; users' devices will try higher priority routes first, and use the lower priority ones only if those are not available. This way, you can optimize your traffic usage per server/domain according to your needs.
